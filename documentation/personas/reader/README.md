## Inspiration and Motivation Seekers
- [READER-INSP-001](./READER-INSP-001.md) - Looking for encouragement and positive reinforcement

## Reputation Evaluators
- [READER-EVAL-001](./READER-EVAL-001.md) - Looking to form an opinion about you or your work

## Purpose-Based Categories

```
Personal Development → Inspiration → Reputation Evaluation
(Skill Building)        (Emotional)   (Assessment)
```
